    <p>Generated story: <span id="noun">_______________(plural noun)</span>. I thought it was a very
    <span id="adjective">_______________(adjective)</span> idea. In swimming class,
        we needed to swim extremely
        <span id="adverb">_______________(adverb)</span>, or else we would have to
        swim longer.
        Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
        my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
        minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
        shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
        my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
        back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!
